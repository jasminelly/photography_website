      	<p class="aboutText">To me, photography is not just about taking an image, it's about the thrill of chasing the perfect shot. Whether I am hiking in the wee hours of the morning to get a picture of mist rolling over Hurricane Ridge or standing knee deep in the cold La Jolla surf with my tripod waiting for the sun to set, I try to immerse myself in the elements. And even if I never click the shutter, I never regret trying to explore and fight to see the world through a unique perspective.<br><br/>

        As a kid, I had some experience with other art mediums, but photography really had a way of grounding me into nature, people, and reality. I desperately wanted to create memorable images, so I watched countless Youtube videos and spent hours examining Ansel Adams's landscapes of Half Dome and Joel Meyerowitz's scenes of Provincetown. I learned about the importance of exposure, the significance of lines and shapes in composition, and the necessity of seeing things through different perspectives. I took numerous pictures, training my mind to be creative while still maintaining a sense of authenticity. I learned that technique was a means of transforming a scene into a photograph as accurately as possible while recognizing the importance of eliciting a response in the viewer--even if the viewer is just me.<br><br/>

        I've also realized that my love for photography, this medium of self-expression, goes beyond the art itself; it's an important connection that I have with the more explorative and curious part of my identity. Every photo I take, whether in the sun-kissed canals of Venice or in my backyard, inspires me to study life, learn, grow, and find some meaning in it all.<br><br/>

        As an individual constantly searching for meaning in my life, I try to look beyond what I am familiar with and never neglect the unknown. Traversing new paths and exploring new frontiers imparts a creative perspective in my everlasting journey towards self-actualization. Whether the voyage is through thick rainforests, gravel paths, or misty mountains, I rely on my own curiosity to find what is uncertain. The more places I discover, the closer I get to discovering myself.<br><br/><br><br/><br><br/>
